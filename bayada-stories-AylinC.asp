				<h1 style="color: #d5242f;" class="stories-h2">Look at Her Now! 7-Year-Old Aylin C. Graduated from BAYADA Pediatrics Care</h1>
				<br><br>
				<img style="float:right ;width:35%;margin-left:15px;" src="images/bayada-stories/Aylin.jpg" alt="Client Milestone Spotlight Aylin C. | Pediatric Care" />
				<p>Imagine yourself in this position. It’s been only a year since you moved from the Dominican
					Republic to the United
					States to be with your new husband. You’re still learning English. You’re a new expectant
					mother. And now, your
					doctors
					tell you that your child will be born with a serious congenital heart condition.</p>
				<p>Sound scary? It certainly was for Yenni and her husband Julio (Junior).</p>
				<p>In the summer of 2012, Yenni and Junior’s beautiful newborn daughter Aylin (pronounced Eileen)
					was diagnosed with
					Tetralogy of Fallot, a rare condition caused by a combination of four congenital heart defects.
				</p>
				<p>At the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), more than two hours from home, Aylin had
					multiple heart surgeries.
					She received a tracheostomy (surgical opening in her throat) for a breathing tube, so that her
					respiration could be
					supported by a ventilator 24/7. And she received a gastrojejunostomy (GJ), a surgical feeding
					connection to the
					small
					intestine, because her condition prevented her from eating by mouth.</p>
				<p>Young Aylin lived most of her first nine months in the hospital, not knowing the outdoors, until
					she finally was
					cleared
					for discharge and came home to stay with her parents.</p>
				<h2><span class="bay-grey">Coming home with a medically fragile child</span></h2><br>
				<img style="float:right ;width:35%;margin-left:15px;" src="images/bayada-stories/Aylin3.jpg" alt="Client Milestone Spotlight Aylin C. | Pediatric Care" />
				<p>BAYADA Transitional Care Manager <b>Mary Simrell</b>, RN had worked with Aylin’s parents at CHOP for
					months to get them ready for discharge and to match them with the best clinicians to provide her
					care at home. Aylin’s home nursing care team, led by BAYADA Clinical Manager <b>Lisette Alicea</b>,
					RN, RRT, were by their side at every step in the process: personally getting to know them and
					Aylin’s medical history; working with her doctors to create a care plan; setting up their home
					environment with medical equipment, medications and supplies; educating them on what to expect; and
					accompanying them door-to-door from hospital to home. From the moment she arrived at their
					apartment, Aylin received 16 hours of nursing care every day, split between day and night shifts.
				</p>
				<p>Aylin had very complex medical needs in the beginning. She was on a ventilator, required continuous
					feeding and suction overnight, and needed the more invasive kind of feeding tube because of a weak
					epiglottis and severe reflux, putting her at high risk of aspiration (drawing liquid into the
					lungs). </p>
				<p>Even though she’d received medical care training in the hospital, Yenni still felt afraid to be alone
					at first. “Everything was new to me as a first-time mother, but the nurses helped me a lot. Having
					them there with me at home helped me feel more comfortable with my baby.”</p>
				<p>Yenni also really appreciated their nurses’ help making phone calls and doctors’ appointments while
					she was building her fluency in English. Aylin’s clinical manager and other nurses on her team were
					bilingual, making it easy for the new mother to ask questions and feel understood. </p>
				<h2><span class="bay-grey">Health challenges: from overwhelming to overcoming</span></h2><br>
				<img style="float:left ;width:30%;margin-right:15px;" src="images/bayada-stories/Aylin2.JPG" alt="Client Milestone Spotlight Aylin C. | Pediatric Care" />
				<p>Just like many children with congenital diagnoses, Aylin was delayed on her early developmental
					milestones, such as sitting up, due to muscle weakness from having been bedridden in the hospital.
					But her physical therapist worked with her over time. </p>
				<p>Soon, Aylin was receiving multiple speech, physical, and occupational therapies and early
					intervention at home with a teacher who kept her moving along with her milestones and helped to
					encourage her to speak—something that’s not easy to do with a breathing tube. </p>
				<p>Despite her medical fragility, Aylin’s parents always had high expectations for her to grow up just
					like any other child. They never took no for an answer, especially her dad. With ingenuity and a lot
					of zip ties, he made Aylin a custom walker and a customized little red wagon, so she could bring her
					medical equipment on a walk or to the park and be as active as her family and peers. “We went
					everywhere. We went sledding, we went tubing, we didn’t let anything stop us,” Yenni remembers. </p>
				<p><b>Maite Roman</b>, LPN was one of Aylin’s day nurses at the time. “Aylin’s level of activity and
					mental acuity kept us on our toes. She was always moving, and even though she was on a trach tube
					and feeding tube, she still wanted to get into things and put everything in her mouth. We had to be
					vigilant with her safety precautions. It was scary at times, because if her GJ tube came dislodged,
					that’d require a trip to the hospital. Once she graduated to a button GT (a less invasive feeding
					port, or gastro tube, at the upper stomach), we could relax a bit.”</p>
				<p>By the time Aylin went to preschool accompanied by her BAYADA Nurse, she still had her stoma
					(surgical openings in her throat and belly), but she was breathing independently and could travel
					the halls tube-free, with a backup ventilator at the ready. </p>
				<h2><span class="bay-grey">Here comes Aylin!</span></h2><br>
				<img style="float:right ;width:35%;margin-left:15px;" src="images/bayada-stories/Aylin1.jpg" alt="Client Milestone Spotlight Aylin C. | Pediatric Care" />
				<p>By the summer of 2019, Aylin had her tubes removed completely and graduated from home health care
					services. Other than her heart condition, Aylin is a healthy, normal child, with all the same energy
					and curiosities as her peers. Now at the age of seven, she and her family no longer need daily
					support, and Aylin is in first grade with an individualized education program (IEP). She has at
					least one more surgical heart procedure ahead of her, but it will be a lot easier than those in the
					past.</p>
				<p>“We’re doing so good now!” Yenni exclaims. “She doesn’t need meds. She doesn’t need oxygen. She eats
					solid food. She doesn’t get sick. God has blessed us.”</p>
				<h2><span class="bay-grey">Lessons learned</span></h2><br>
				<p>“Aylin’s parents are the most hospitable and loving family I’ve ever met, and I learned so much from
					them,” Maite reflects fondly. (They still attend all of each other’s extended family birthday
					parties.) “I learned that achieving a child’s best possible outcomes has a lot to do with their
					environment. Aylin’s mom and dad always pushed her, and they were very consistent. Every day they’d
					find ways to motivate her to move and to walk.”</p>
				<p>She adds, “Sometimes I was afraid Aylin would get hurt, but Yenni and Junior knew what was best for
					their daughter, and they never made her feel sheltered or limited. They never let overprotectiveness
					get in the way of her progress. </p>
				<p>From working with Aylin, I see that no matter how much you may know medically, as a clinician, you’re
					never going to know a child like her parents do.” </p>
				<h2><span class="bay-grey">How you can help: Hayden’s Heart Superhero 5K</span></h2><br>
				<p>Raising a child with special medical needs is never easy. Hayden’s Heart is a charitable nonprofit
					organization founded by the Dorsett family, whose son Hayden also was treated at CHOP in 2012 for
					congenital heart disease (CHD) and succumbed to his illness at the age of five months. Every year,
					they choose a family to be the beneficiaries of their Superhero 5K, to help with the significant
					medical expenses associated with CHD. Aylin was nominated by her BAYADA Clinical Manager and chosen
					as their 5K honoree in 2017.</p>
