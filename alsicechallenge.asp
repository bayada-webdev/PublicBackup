				<h1>BAYADA ALS Ice Bucket Challenge</h1>
				<p>The Ice Bucket Challenge truly soaked the nation and as a proud partner of The ALS Association, BAYADA seized the opportunity to get involved. Over 80 BAYADA offices took the plunge to defeat ALS. Not only did BAYADA employees douse themselves with ice water for a good cause, but they also did a phenomenal job in raising funds for the disease. BAYADA has made over $6,000 in contributions to The ALSA from the Ice Bucket Challenge alone!</p>
				<p>The ALS Association has received over $100 million in donations from the Ice Bucket Challenge. During the same time period last year (July 29 to August 29), The ALSA only received $2.8 million. There have been over three million donors for the challenge. ALS has not received this much attention since Lou Gehrig delivered his retirement speech 75 years ago and the impact of the Ice Bucket Challenge will surely make a difference in research initiatives and care services.</p>
