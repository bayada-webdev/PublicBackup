            <h1>BAYADA Going Green: Environmental Mission Statement</h1>
            <h2>Show love to the earth</h2>

            <p>Adopting environmentally conscientious practices is directly aligned with BAYADA Home Health Care’s vision of <span class="italics">building a lasting legacy to help people have a safe home life with comfort, independence, and dignity</span>.</p>

            <p>Our clients’ health&mdash;as well as our own&mdash;depends on a healthy environment and stable ecosystems that can support humanity. We believe it is our responsibility to provide the highest standard of care to our clients while reducing strain on the world around us.</p>

            <p>Therefore, BAYADA pledges to be creative, flexible, and determined in embedding sustainable and responsible practices into our daily work. We will collaborate across offices, share ideas, and celebrate each other’s victories as we reduce waste, harmful emissions, and energy and water use. We also pledge to spread awareness of environmental responsibility and sustainable solutions throughout our communities.</p>

            <h3>Our areas of focus include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spreading awareness of environmental issues and solutions</li>
                    <li>Reducing the use of resources such as energy, water, and office supplies</li>
                    <li>Minimizing our environmental footprint by reducing, reusing, and recycling whenever possible</li>
                </ul><br>

            <p>Recognizing sustainability as a company value will have a continuous positive environmental impact, reduce company costs, and help to ensure a better future for our clients, employees, and communities.</p>
