            		<h2>Working together to bring the highest quality care home</h2>
			<p>At <span class='uppercase'>Bayada</span>, we believe our clients and their families deserve <a class="go" rel="leanModal" href="#HomeHealthCare">home health care</a> provided with the highest professional, ethical, and safety standards.
