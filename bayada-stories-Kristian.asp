				</h1>
				<br><br>
				<p>Amy O. describes her youngest son Kristian as full of personality. The eight-year-old is a familiar
					presence at church, where his passion for singing takes center stage. At home, there’s a good chance
					you’ll find him playing “Mary Had a Little Lamb” on the piano or banging out a new rhythm on the
					xylophone or drums.
				</p>

				<p>Kristian lives with his parents, two sisters and a brother in Lindstrom, a lake-filled region of
					eastern Minnesota, where his BAYADA Nurses have become like part of the family. BAYADA Pediatrics
					has provided in-home nursing care for Kristian ever since he was discharged from the hospital
					shortly before his first birthday. Born with a rare condition that left him without a rib cage on
					his right side, Kristian also lives with a seizure disorder.
				</p>
				<p>“He has had 20 surgeries in his short eight years,” said his BAYADA Clinical Manager Anita Bierman,
					RN, who oversees all aspects of his care. “He’s doing really well now. He needed a tracheostomy and
					ventilator to breathe for most of his life, but now he can go off the ventilator for 13 hours, and
					only needs it at night.” </p>
				<p>Kristian’s nurses provide care at his home during the overnight hours and accompany him to school
					where they tend to his medical needs in his first-grade classroom. However, since schools closed due
					to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, he has been forced to stay home.</p>
				<p>Kristian really missed his normal routine, so when his birthday came around last month, Amy wanted to
					do something special to cheer him up. After a friend from church posted on Facebook, the residents
					of their close-knit, small town decided they were not about to let the COVID-19 crisis stop them
					from celebrating one of their own. </p><br>
					<img style="float:left ;width:35%;margin-right:25px;" src="images/bayada-stories/Kristian3.jpg"

				<p>Spearheaded by the local police and fire departments, more than 50 decorated cars filled with
					neighbors, friends, and yes, many of Kristian’s nurses formed a make-shift parade as they wound
					their way through town en route to Kristian’s home. </p>
				<p>Instead of presents, Amy suggested the parade participants drop off donations for a local food bank.
					All told, this generous community collected 240 pounds of food in Kristian’s honor.</p>
				<p>“We gathered at the top of our driveway to watch the parade go by,” shared Amy. “Kristian was so
					excited and overwhelmed. It was the best birthday he ever had.”</p>
				<p>BAYADA provides pediatric nursing care at home for children from birth through adolescence with a
					wide range of diagnoses. To learn more, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bayada.com/pediatrics/">click here >></a> </p>
