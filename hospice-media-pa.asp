			<h2>Volunteers</h2>
			<p>IIn addition to our office and field teams, volunteers make an important difference in the lives of our patients and their families. Some provide companionship, run errands, or help with other tasks. But no matter what they do, they are a gift!</p>

			<p>To celebrate our volunteers during Volunteer Appreciation Week we hosted an appreciation luncheon for office volunteers and team members to express our gratitude to all who care for our patients. During the event, volunteers shared stories of rewarding experiences with their patients and families, and everyone had a great time. If you or someone you know would like to volunteer with us, please let us know! We provide a flexible training and orientation schedule to meet your needs.</p>

			<p>We are also a Level 1 participant in the <a href="http://wehonorveterans.org/">We Honor Veterans program</a>.</p>

			<h2>Bereavement program</h2>
			<p>We know how difficult it can be to lose a loved one, and we provide help and support in many different ways. For example, non-denominational memorial services are held during holiday seasons to help people remember loved ones and be supported in their grief during a difficult time of year. Ask us about our bereavement program to learn more.</p>
