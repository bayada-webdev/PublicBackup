		        	<p><span class='uppercase'>Bayada</span> <a class="go" rel="leanModal" href="#Habilitation">Habilitation</a> is an accredited program that helps clients with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live safely at home and participate in their communities with comfort, independence, and dignity. This specialty program serves clients in North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, who have <a class="go" rel="leanModal" href="#ASD">autism spectrum disorders</a>, intellectual and developmental disabilities, cerebral palsy, and other developmental disabilities.</p>

		        	<p>While many of the services we provide involve personal care assistance, what sets <span class='uppercase'>Bayada</span> apart is our focus on community integration. Our approach to habilitation involves teaching clients to do things for themselves &mdash; like brushing their teeth, managing money, shopping for personal items. Together, we help our clients to live more independently and safely at home and in the community, while offering periodic relief for family members and <a class="go" rel="leanModal" href="#CaregiverFamily">caregivers</a> through respite services. The <a class="go" rel="leanModal" href="#CARF">Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities International (CARF)</a> has validated our efforts in community integration, respite, and personal support services.</p>
