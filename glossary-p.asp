                    <td class="define">Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system that affects more than one million Americans. Individuals with PD lack a substance called dopamine, which is important in the central nervous system’s control of muscle activity. PD is often characterized by
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tremors</li>
                            <li>Stiffness in limbs and joints</li>

                        </ul>
                    Late in the course of the disease, some individuals develop dementia and eventually Alzheimer’s disease. Medications such as levodopa, which prevents degeneration of dopamine, are used to improve diminished motor symptoms in PD patients but do not correct the mental changes that it causes.</td>
