Created in 1965, CHAP was the first accrediting body for community-based health care organizations in the US. CHAP was granted “deeming authority” by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 1992 for home health and in 1999 for hospice. In March 2012, CHAP was granted a renewal of their deeming authority for home health for the maximum six-year term. This helps BAYADA fulfill the goal to grow and serve millions of people worldwide.</td>
