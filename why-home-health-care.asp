			<h1>Why home health care?</h1>

			<p>There are many reasons why people may need health care at home. Some are recovering from surgery or have a chronic condition requiring ongoing care. Others need therapies or assistance with <a class="go" rel="leanModal" href="#ADL">activities of daily living</a>.</p>
			<p>Many of our clients want to remain in their own homes, surrounded by family and friends because nothing is better than the comfort of home. Not only is <a class="go" rel="leanModal" href="#HomeHealthCare">home health care</a> preferred by most people, it is also an affordable choice.</p>
