			<p><span class='uppercase'>Bayada</span> Habilitation provides quality, compassionate services for children and adults on the autism spectrum, including Asperger syndrome. Our services enable individuals on the autism spectrum with intellectual or developmental disabilities to learn, maintain, and improve skills related to communication, socialization, and behavior.</p>

			<p>Our <span class='uppercase'>Bayada</span> Habilitation professionals provide individualized instructional and positive behavioral supports to those with autism in the comfort of their own home, community or school. These services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our goals are to help individuals with autism spectrum disorders live safely at home and to participate in their communities with confidence, independence, and success.</p>

			<h3>Proven strategies for success</h3>
			<p>We are dedicated to serving children and adults on the autism spectrum with the highest quality of care, using strategies and models that are clinically accepted best practices. Our services are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure we offer the most current, effective techniques developing strong behavioral foundations, enhancing the ability to learn and increasing functional independence.</p>

			<h3>Applied behavior analysis (ABA) - An early intensive behavioral intervention</h3>
			<p><span class='uppercase'>Bayada</span> Habilitation offers applied behavior analysis (ABA) as an evidence-based proven intervention strategy in the reduction of challenging behaviors and the increase of functional skills for individuals with autism spectrum disorders. The ABA strategy is an applied science that uses clearly defined procedures to address social, communication, behavioral, and self-help deficits.</p>

			<p><span class='uppercase'>Bayada</span> Habilitation professionals customize their teaching around several ABA methodologies, including, but not limited to Pivotal Response Training (PRT), Errorless Teaching, Visual supports, Social stories, Differential Reinforcement, Discrete Trial Teaching, and Natural Environment Training. These methodologies have been proven most successful for autism disorders or related learning or social disorders.</p>

			<h3>Individualized care for your child</h3>
			<p>Depending on age and ability of each child, the earliest portions of <span class='uppercase'>Bayada</span> Habilitation autism services focus on basic verbal and nonverbal communication as tools for learning-readiness, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Increasing receptive and expressive language</li>
					<li>Eye contact</li>
					<li>Gesturing</li>
					<li>Social interaction</li>
				</ul><br>
