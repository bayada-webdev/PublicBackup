				<h1>Home Health Care</h1>

				<h2>Bringing health care home &mdash; where you want to be</h2>
				<p><span class='uppercase'>Bayada</span> Home Health Care is a trusted provider of clinical and assistive care services at home for adults of all ages.

				<p>Our services for adults are organized into three specialty practices: Home Health, Adult Nursing, and Assistive Care.
				</p>

				<p><a href="/services-home-health.asp">Home Health</a> professionals provide adults and seniors with short-term nursing, rehabilitative, therapeutic, and assistive home health care services. This care is provided by registered nurses (RNs), physical therapists (PTs), occupational therapists (OTs), speech language pathologists (SLPs), home health aides (HHAs) and medical social workers (MSWs) as a limited number of up to one hour visits, primarily through the Medicare Home Health benefit. <a href="/services-home-health.asp">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

				<p><a href="/services-adult-nursing.asp">Adult Nursing</a> professionals provide nursing care services at home for adults and seniors dealing with chronic illness, injury, or disability. These services are provided by registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) primarily on an ongoing shift (two-hour or more) basis, and are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This care is also sometimes referred to as private duty or adult skilled nursing. <a href="/services-adult-nursing.asp">&gt;&gt;</a></p>

				<p><a href="/services-assistive-care.asp">Assistive Care</a> professionals provide non-medical assistance with activities of daily living for adults and seniors including self-care and household support services.
